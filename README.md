## Introduction:

This is a flask app that visualizes data from the COVID-19 API. Data is pulled directly from the API and then visualized using Plotly.

This flask app first gives an overview of the three base languages for web development: **html, css, and JavaScript** to work with the web template and make a data dashboard. If you want to customize the dashboard, you can do so with just a few changes to the html code but the underlying technologies of data dashboard will be css, html, JavaScript, and Python.
