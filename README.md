## Introduction:

This is a flask app that visualizes data from the COVID-19 API. Data is pulled directly from the API and then visualized using Plotly.

This flask app first gives an overview of the three base languages for web development: **html, css**, and **JavaScript** to work with the web template and make a data dashboard. If you want to customize the dashboard, you can do so with just a few changes to the html code but the underlying technologies of data dashboard will be css, html, JavaScript, and Python.

## Prerequisites

To install the flask app, you need:

  * python3
  * python packages in the requirements.txt file

Install the packages with

 * pip install -r requirements.txt

## Installing

On a MacOS/linux/Window system, installation is easy. Open a terminal, and go into the directory with the flask app files. Run python **python covid19.py** in the terminal then open a new web browser window, and type the following in the address bar:

          http://localhost:3001/

* DON'T FORGET TO INCLUDE-3001. You should be able to see the web app. The number 3001 represents the port for accessing your web app.
